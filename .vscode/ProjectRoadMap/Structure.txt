Automation Road Map for Project OLA
// Tools and Technologies
    Automation Framework: 
        Cypress
    Languages: 
        JavaScript, TypeScript
    Reporting: 
        Allure Reporting (exportable to XLSX format)
//Project Structure
    We follow the Page Object Model (POM) structure for better code reusability and maintenance. Below is the detailed folder structure and its purpose:
    Fixtures
     Description: 
        Stores all the data used in the project in JSON format.
     Usage:
         Helps in managing test data separately from test scripts.
    Locators
     Description:
         Contains XPATH/CSS selectors of the application.
    Usage: 
        Centralizes element locators for easy maintenance and updates.
    Pages
     Description: 
        Represents the pages of the application we want to automate.
    Usage: 
        Contains page-specific methods and interactions.
    Test Cases
     Description:
         Contains test scripts that call the pages and write test scenarios using describe and it blocks.
     Usage: 
        Executes automated test scripts and validates application functionality.
    Screenshots/Videos
     Description:
         Stores screenshots and videos of test execution.
     Usage: 
        Automatically captures screenshots on test failure and records videos for headless browser test runs.
    Utils
     Description:
         Contains custom functions used repeatedly in the project.
     Usage: 
        Promotes code reusability by storing utility functions.
//Environment Configurations
    Description:
         Manages environment-specific configurations (e.g., production, staging, QA).
    Usage: 
        Executes tests in different environments using custom commands.
    Configurations (Config)
     Description:
         Stores custom configurations like base URL, default screen size, Allure report configuration, default page timeout, etc.
     Usage: 
        Centralizes project settings for consistency across test executions.
    Package.json
     Description: 
        Contains environment-specific scripts, allure report generation scripts, cross-browser testing scripts, and JSON/CSV file conversion scripts.
     Usage: 
        Manages project dependencies and scripts for various operations.
//Version Control
    Platform: 
        GitHub
            Usage: 
                Maintains the project repository, manages version control, and facilitates team collaboration.
                
//Implementation Details
    Purpose: 
        Cypress is used for end-to-end testing of web applications, including API testing.
