Moreover, Allure Reporting is integrated into the testing framework to generate detailed test reports. These reports provide insights into the testing process and results, helping developers and QA teams identify and address any issues promptly. The application follows the Page Object Model (POM) structure to organize test code efficiently, promoting reusability and maintainability.
